"About": {
  "title": "About the Project",
  "intro": "This platform is a solo project created with the goal of transforming how people learn languages. It combines smart AI features and a user-friendly chat interface to help learners improve naturally and independently.",
  "teamTitle": "About the Creator",
  "teamDescription": "This platform is built by a single developer who wears all the hats: UX designer, backend engineer, frontend developer, and AI integrator. The idea was born out of a desire to create a practical, motivational, and modern tool for language learners. By combining technical skills with a deep interest in education, the creator aimed to develop something meaningful and useful for everyday learners—something that blends simplicity, interactivity, and personal growth.",
  "visionTitle": "Vision",
  "visionDescription": "The vision behind this project is to make language learning more than just studying vocabulary or grammar. It’s about daily interaction, context-based improvement, and building confidence through use. The platform is designed to help people integrate language into their daily routine through chat-based exercises, real-time feedback, and AI-powered analysis—without the pressure of a traditional classroom. The goal is to empower independent learners and make self-paced language learning feel intuitive, rewarding, and human."
